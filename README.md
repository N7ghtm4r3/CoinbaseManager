# CoinbaseManager
**v1.1.0**

This is a Java Based library useful to work with Coinbase's API service.

## Implementation

Add the JitPack repository to your build file

### Gradle

- Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories

```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ...
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
- Add the dependency

```gradle
dependencies {
	implementation 'com.github.N7ghtm4r3:CoinbaseManager:1.1.0'
}
```

### Maven

- Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>jitpack.io</id>
        <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```
- Add the dependency

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.github.N7ghtm4r3</groupId>
    <artifactId>CoinbaseManager</artifactId>
    <version>1.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## 🛠 Skills
- Java

## Managers available

- Coinbase Pro/Exchange

The other managers will be gradually released

## Usage/Examples

### Execution

```java
// init a Coinbase manager
try {  
   CoinbaseManager coinbaseManager = new CoinbaseManager("yourApiKey", "yourSecretKey", "yourPassphrase");
} catch(Exception e){
   e.printStackTrace();
}
```

To avoid re-entering credentials for each manager, you can instantiate managers like this with the **ARCS**:

```java
// choose the manager for example: CoinbaseProductsManager, CoinbaseUsersManager, etc 
CoinbaseManager firstManager = new CoinbaseManager(/* params of the constructor chosen */, "apiKey", "apiSign", "yourPassphrase");
// and then use it 
firstManager.makeSomething();
// you don't need to insert all credentials to make manager work
CoinbaseManager secondManager = new CoinbaseManager(); // same credentials used
// and then use it
secondManager.makeSomething();
```

### Responses

Library give to you the opportunity to customize the return object after a request, the possibilities are:

- **JSON:** return response formatted as **JSON** (**org.json.JSONObject** or **org.json.JSONArray**)
- **STRING:** return response formatted as **String**
- **LIBRARY_OBJECT:** return response formatted as custom object offered by the library

```java
// choose the manager for example: Gmail, etc 
CoinbaseManager manager = new CoinbaseManager(/* params of the constructor chosen */);
// method to return directly a library given by library
manager.someRequest(); // in this case will be returned directly a LIBRARY_OBJECT
// method to customize the format of the return 
manager.someRequest(ReturnFormat.JSON); // in this case will be returned response in JSON format
```

### Errors handling

```java
try {
    System.out.println(coinbaseProductsManager.getProductStats("BTC-USD"));
} catch (Exception e) {
    System.out.println(coinbaseProductsManager.getErrorResponse());
    //or
    coinbaseProductsManager.printErrorResponse();   
}
/* NOTE: if is not a request error will appear: "Error is not in api request, check out your code"
  and you will have to work on your code to manage error, you can also change default error message*/
```
